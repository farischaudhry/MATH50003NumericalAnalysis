# Polynomial Interpolation and Regression

In this section we switch tracks and begin to consider numerical linear algebra related to rectangular matrices and least squares systems, which we motivate with an application to polynomial regression.
_Polynomial interpolation_ is the process of finding a polynomial that equals data at a precise set of points.
A more robust scheme is _polynomial regression_ where we use more data than the degrees of freedom in the polynomial. We therefore determine the polynomial using _least squares_: find
the polynomial whose samples at the points are as close as possible to the data, as measured in the $2$-norm. This least squares problem is done numerically which will be discussed in the next few sections.


## Polynomial interpolation

Our prelimary goal is given a set of points $x_j$ and data $f_j$, usually samples of a function
$f_j = f(x_j)$, find a polynomial that interpolates the data at the points:

**Definition (interpolatory polynomial)** Given _distinct_ points $𝐱 = \vectt[x_1,…,x_n] ∈ 𝔽^n$
and _data_ $𝐟 = \vectt[f_1,…,f_n] ∈ 𝔽^n$, a degree $n-1$
_interpolatory polynomial_ $p(x)$ satisfies
$$
p(x_j) = f_j
$$
∎

The easiest way to solve this problem is to invert the Vandermonde system:

**Definition (Vandermonde)** The _Vandermonde matrix_ associated with $𝐱 ∈ 𝔽^m$
is the matrix
$$
V_{𝐱,n} := \begin{bmatrix} 1 & x_1 & ⋯ & x_1^{n-1} \\
                    ⋮ & ⋮ & ⋱ & ⋮ \\
                    1 & x_m & ⋯ & x_m^{n-1}
                    \end{bmatrix} ∈ 𝔽^{m × n}.
$$
When it is clear from context we omit the subscripts $𝐱,n$.
∎

Writing the coefficients of a polynomial
$$
p(x) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^k
$$
as a vector
 $𝐜 = \vectt[c_0,…,c_{n-1}] ∈ 𝔽^n$, we note that $V$ encodes the linear map from coefficients to values at a grid, that is,
$$
V𝐜 = \Vectt[c_0 + c_1 x_1 + ⋯ + c_{n-1} x_1^{n-1}, ⋮, c_0 + c_1 x_m + ⋯ + c_{n-1} x_m^{n-1}] = \Vectt[p(x_1),⋮,p(x_m)].
$$
In the square case (where $m=n$), the coefficients of an interpolatory polynomial are given by $𝐜 = V^{-1} 𝐟$, so that
$$
\Vectt[p(x_1),⋮,p(x_n)] = V 𝐜 = V V^{-1} 𝐟 = \Vectt[f_1,⋮,f_n].
$$
This inversion is justified by the following:

**Proposition (interpolatory polynomial uniqueness)**
Interpolatory polynomials are unique and therefore square Vandermonde matrices are invertible.

**Proof**
Suppose $p$ and $\pt$ are both interpolatory polynomials of the same function. Then $p(x) - \pt(x)$ vanishes at $n$ distinct points $x_j$. By the fundamental theorem of
algebra it must be zero, i.e., $p = \pt$.

For the second part, if $V 𝐜 = 0$ for $𝐜 = \vectt[c_0,…,c_{n-1}] ∈ 𝔽^n$ then for $q(x) = c_0 + ⋯ + c_{n-1} x^{n-1}$ we have
$$
q(x_j) = 𝐞_j^⊤ V 𝐜 = 0
$$
hence $q$ vanishes at $n$ distinct points and is therefore 0, i.e., $𝐜 = 0$.

∎


We can invert square Vandermonde matrix numerically in $O(n^3)$ operations using the PLU factorisation.
But it turns out we can also construct the interpolatory polynomial directly, and evaluate the polynomial in only $O(n^2)$ operations.
We will use the following polynomials which equal $1$ at one grid point and zero at the others:

**Definition (Lagrange basis polynomial)** The _Lagrange basis polynomial_ is defined as
$$
ℓ_k(x) := ∏_{j ≠ k} {x-x_j \over x_k - x_j} =  {(x-x_1) ⋯(x-x_{k-1})(x-x_{k+1}) ⋯ (x-x_n) \over (x_k - x_1) ⋯ (x_k - x_{k-1}) (x_k - x_{k+1}) ⋯ (x_k - x_n)}
$$
∎

Plugging in the grid points verifies that: $ℓ_k(x_j) = δ_{kj}$.

We can use these to construct the interpolatory polynomial:

**Theorem (Lagrange interpolation)**
The unique interpolation polynomial is:
$$
p(x) = f_1 ℓ_1(x) + ⋯ + f_n ℓ_n(x)
$$

**Proof**
Note that
$$
p(x_j) = ∑_{j=1}^n f_j ℓ_k(x_j) = f_j.
$$
∎

**Example (interpolating an exponential)** We can interpolate $\exp(x)$ at the points $0,1,2$.
That is, our data is $𝐟 = \vectt[{\rm e}, {\rm e},{\rm e}^2]$ and the interpolatory polynomial is
$$
\begin{align*}
p(x) &= ℓ_1(x) + {\rm e} ℓ_2(x) + {\rm e}^2 ℓ_3(x) =
{(x - 1) (x-2) \over (-1)(-2)} + {\rm e} {x (x-2) \over (-1)} +
{\rm e}^2 {x (x-1) \over 2} \\
&= (1/2 - {\rm e} +{\rm e}^2/2)x^2 + (-3/2 + 2 {\rm e}  - {\rm e}^2 /2) x + 1
\end{align*}
$$
∎


**Remark** Interpolating at evenly spaced points is a really _bad_ idea:
interpolation is inheritely ill-conditioned.
The labs will explore this issue experimentally. Another
serious issue is that monomials are a horrible basis for interpolation. This is intuitive: when $n$ is large $x^n$ is basically zero near the origin and hence $x_j^n$ numerically lose linear independence, that is, on a computer they appear to be linearly dependent (up to rounding errors). We will discuss alternative bases in Part IV.

## Polynomial regression



In many settings interpolation is not an accurate or appropriate tool. Data is often on an evenly spaced grid in which case (as seen in the labs)
interpolation breaks down catastrophically. Or the data is noisy and one ends up over resolving: approximating the
noise rather than the signal. A simple solution is _polynomial regression_ use more sample points than than the degrees of freedom in the polynomial. The special case of an affine polynomial is called _linear regression_.

More precisely, for $𝐱 ∈ 𝔽^m$ and for $n < m$ we want to find a degree $n-1$ polynomial
$$
p(x) = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^k
$$
such that
$$
\Vectt[p(x_1), ⋮, p(x_m)] ≈ \underbrace{\Vectt[f_1,⋮,f_m]}_{𝐟}.
$$
Mapping between coefficients $𝐜 ∈ 𝔽^n$ to polynomial values on a grid can be accomplished 
via rectangular Vandermonde matrices. In particular, our goal is to choose $𝐜 ∈ 𝔽^n$ so that
$$
V 𝐜  = \Vectt[p(x_1), ⋮, p(x_m)] ≈ 𝐟.
$$
We do so by solving the _least squares_ system: given $V ∈ 𝔽^{m × n}$ and $𝐟 ∈ 𝔽^m$ we want to find $𝐜 ∈ 𝔽^n$ such that
$$
\| V 𝐜 - 𝐟 \|
$$
is minimal. Note interpolation is a special case where this norm is precisely zero (which is indeed minimal), but in general this norm may be rather large.   We will discuss the numerical solution
of least squares problems in the next few sections.


**Remark** Using regression instead of interpolation can overcome the issues with evenly spaced grids. However, the monomial basis is still very problematic.
